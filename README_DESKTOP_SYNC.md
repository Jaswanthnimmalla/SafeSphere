---

## 💾 **DATA PERSISTENCE**

All data is stored in browser's `localStorage`:

- ✅ Add passwords → They save instantly
- ✅ Refresh page → Data still there
- ✅ Close browser → Data persists
- ✅ 100% offline (no cloud!)

---

## 🔒 **SECURITY**

### **Why the browser shows a security warning:**

The local server uses HTTP (not HTTPS). This is:

- ✅ **NORMAL** for local network servers
- ✅ **SAFE** - only accessible on your WiFi
- ✅ **CORRECT** - same as router admin pages

**Just click "Continue to site" - it's your own phone serving the page!**

### **How it stays secure:**

- ✅ Only accessible on your local network
- ✅ Session keys prevent unauthorized access
- ✅ No data sent to internet
- ✅ 100% local & offline

---

## 🛑 **HOW TO STOP**

1. Go back to SafeSphere app
2. Navigate to Desktop Sync screen
3. Tap **"🛑 Stop Desktop Sync"**
4. Server stops immediately

---

## 🎯 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Can't connect?**

- ✅ Make sure phone is on WiFi (not mobile data)
- ✅ Make sure computer is on SAME WiFi network
- ✅ Try phone's browser first to test server is working
- ✅ Check if port 8888 is blocked by firewall

### **Security warning won't go away?**

- Just tap "Continue to site" or "Advanced" → "Proceed"
- It's safe - it's YOUR phone serving YOUR data locally!

### **Data not persisting?**

- Browser might be in Private/Incognito mode
